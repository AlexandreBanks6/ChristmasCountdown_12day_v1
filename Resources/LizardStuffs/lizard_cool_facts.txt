Geckos have microscopic hair on their feet!!
The biggest lizard is the Komodo dragon and these boys can be up to 2.6 meters long!!
They can be old boyz too, living up to 50 years!!! No way, that do be nuts lol.
Also, you know those funky frills that some lizards have, those are used to scare off predators!
